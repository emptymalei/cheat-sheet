# Cheat Sheet

#### An Electron app for keeping the small coding notes you always forget. 

There are certain concepts, algorithms or methods that you use infrequently enough to the point where you never commit it to memory and have to look it up everytime. Cheat Sheet solves the problem of not having to go to StackOverflow or Google to find the same code snippet or tutorial repeatedly. With Cheat Sheet you can create, sort and tag little "cheats" for easy lookup right on your desktop.

Cheat Sheet is built on GitHub's Electron framework, so it runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
